# Pencil Sketches Folder

## Download Pencil [here](http://pencil.evolus.vn/Downloads.html)

This folder contains Pencil sketches for a basic layout/storyboard of the
eauser application. I have noticed that when opening these files they may 
be not show all text right away; I've needed to click on attributes to expose
the text that was visible when they were saved.
TL;DR the files don't look identical to when they were saved. Click on stuff 
to refresh.
